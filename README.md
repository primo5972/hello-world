# hello-world

Hey guys, and gals,

My name is Joe, I am first and foremost a Dad of two beautiful boys (Joey 6.5 LOL, and Drew 4) A husband to the most beautiful of brides.I`m 38 years old, from Boston (Medford actually) but now live on the South Shore it’s a real culture shock (for those that are in the know, will understand LOL)  :p I have been in the restaurant industry and managing them for almost 20 years and now it’s my time to come back to school and finish my degree and do something I love. Something I am passionate about, I love video games and movies so that is why I`m enrolled in the computer programming and game development program. My favorite game for the past three years is Destiny. An FPS (first person shooter) that is an MMO (mass multiplayer online) RPG (role playing game) I`m on the XBox One. My dream would be to work for Bungie or Bethesda or 2K, probably in that order. If I worked for a movie company Disney takes top honors.
